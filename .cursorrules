### Core Principles
1. Write clean, maintainable code
   - Keep code simple and readable
   - Follow consistent formatting
   - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names

2. Prioritize reliability
   - If a feature cannot be made reliable, do not implement it
   - Test thoroughly after each significant change
   - Focus on core functionality before optimizations
   - Implement features using the simplest viable approach

3. Think before coding
   - Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining your reasoning
   - Understand requirements fully before starting
   - Plan detailed next steps
   - Leave assumptions and ego aside

### Error Handling
1. Systematic debugging
   - Consider multiple potential causes
   - Avoid jumping to conclusions
   - Explain issues in plain English
   - Make minimal necessary code changes
   - Always verify fixes work as intended

2. When encountering unusual errors
   - Request user to search Perplexity for latest information
   - Stay up-to-date with current best practices
   - Validate solutions against recent documentation

### Development Process
1. Before implementation
   - Ensure complete understanding of requirements
   - Document planned approach
   - Break down into manageable steps

2. During implementation
   - Test after every meaningful change
   - Keep code focused and modular
   - Maintain simplicity as a core value
   - Document key decisions and reasoning

3. Code review
   - Verify against initial requirements
   - Check for clarity and simplicity
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Confirm all tests pass

### Communication
1. With users
   - Use clear, non-technical language when explaining issues
   - Provide step-by-step guidance
   - Ask for clarification when needed
   - Suggest alternatives when appropriate

2. In code
   - Write clear comments explaining complex logic
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document assumptions and limitations
   - Keep documentation up-to-date

### Error Handling
1. Systematic debugging
   - Consider multiple potential causes
   - Avoid jumping to conclusions
   - Explain issues in plain English
   - Make minimal necessary code changes
   - Always verify fixes work as intended

2. When encountering unusual errors
   - Request user to search Perplexity for latest information
   - Stay up-to-date with current best practices
   - Validate solutions against recent documentation

### Major Change Protocol
1. Before implementing major changes:
   - Display prominent warning message
   - List all affected functionality
   - Describe expected behavioral changes
   - Request explicit user confirmation
   - Document decision points

### ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING PROTOCOL
Before making any major functional changes:
```
⚠️ MAJOR CHANGE WARNING ⚠️
I am about to make changes that will significantly alter functionality:
[Description of changes]
[Impact on existing features]
[Potential risks]

2. During major changes:
   - Create backup/snapshot if possible
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Test each step thoroughly
   - Keep user informed of progress
   - Maintain rollback capability

3. After major changes:
   - Verify all affected functionality
   - Document all modifications
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Confirm with user that changes meet requirements
