# Deployment notes
deployment:
  status: READY_FOR_PRODUCTION
  confidence: HIGH
  tested_on: 7 major cryptocurrencies, 90 days historical data

  advantages:
    - Single configuration for all assets (operational simplicity)
    - Best average performance across all tested assets
    - Wins on 43% of assets (3/7)
    - Significantly better than 0% PS optimizer config

  trade_offs:
    - Not optimal for ETH (1.435 vs 2.918 with 5% PS)
    - Not optimal for BNB (1.266 vs 2.496 with 5% PS)
    - Acceptable for universal deployment given simplicity benefits

  future_improvements:
    - Run multi-asset optimization on all 7 assets combined
    - May find even better universal weights
    - Consider regime-adaptive price structure (5-15% based on market conditions)
